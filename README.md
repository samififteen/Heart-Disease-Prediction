# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning ❤️

## Overview
This project utilizes **machine learning algorithms** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. By analyzing various health parameters, the system provides insights that may assist in early diagnosis and preventive care.

## Features
- **Predicts heart disease risk** based on key medical factors
- **Supports multiple ML models** (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- **Data preprocessing & feature engineering** for optimized predictions
- **User-friendly interface** with Flask integration
- **Model evaluation & performance metrics** for validation

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning models)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data manipulation)
- **Flask** (Web integration)
